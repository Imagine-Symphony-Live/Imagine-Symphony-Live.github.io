I was in 7th grade, it was the Fairbanks Youth Orchestra, and I started because my violin teacher recommended it to me.\",\n[v3]: \"I received one on my fifth birthday from my grandparent.\",\n[v4]: \"I really enjoy playing in music groups more so than I actually like playing solo, and just opportunity.\",\n[v5]: \"I was very lucky with my experiences with getting to watch symphony because my mother was the physical therapist for the Houston Symphony Orchestra. And so from a pretty young age (middle school) I was backstage at Houston Symphony concerts meeting all the musicians, and I was a little girl so they thought that was cool, and they would find special seats for me, and play little special licks and wink and me in the middle of the concert and things like that. I just had this idea that people who played in the symphony were the nicest most magical people on the planet. That’s my experience getting to know them as human beings as well as enjoying their music.\",\n[v6]: \"When I was graduating from fifth grade, our sixth grade orchestra teacher (the middle school orchestra teacher) came to talk to the fifth grade class about what instruments we could play in the middle school orchestra. And she demonstrated the violin, and that was fine. And the viola was kinda’ neat, I liked the lower sound. But then when she played the cello, she sat down. And then I thought “that is the instrument for me”. And I actually decided to play the cello when she mentioned that they kept the cellos at school for you, so you didn’t have to carry your cello back and forth to school. And I had been playing piano for a couple years and knew that I didn;t like to practice. And I thought, “well if the cello is at school,  don’t have to bring it home, so I must not have to practice. That is definitely the instrument I want to play.” And I went home, told my mother I want  to play the cello, I don’t want to play the piano anymore. It’s the cello. I don’t know why but she said “Okay we’ll do the cello now”. And of course we rented a cello to keep at home, and there was one at school, and I had to practice a lot. But it was such a social instrument after playing piano that it was a much more satisfying, rewarding experience. Since it was in a group of people and it was kind of competitive, and I liked that.\",\n[v7]: \"I’ve always played in some kind of musical group ever since sixth grade. Played in my college orchestra, played in other community orchestras. So I moved to bend in 2001 and very quickly found the Central Oregon Symphony. [I] Attended the first rehearsal that concert season. Halfway through we all took a break and sat down and ate a meal together and people asked me questions, “Where are you from? How long have you played? What’s your favorite animal?” And it was just immediately community. I felt very welcomed. And I’ve tried to play as many concerts ever since.\",\n[v8]: \"I was very fortunate to live in Portland and went to private school and my first memory is actually my 6th grade band teacher Mr. Evans taking us to an opera, not just a symphony, but an opera. And it was Aida with the elephants on stage and the whole Experience. It was great.\",\n[v9]: \"Why did I start playing my instrument? I love the sound of the French horn. I just love the sound.\",\n[v10]: \"No that's great I don't know what to say seriously you can edit that And make it better Your plan You can do it again If you want though I felt like I saw some\",\n[v11]: \"Because music is something I have to do to make me happy and I enjoy rehearsals, I enjoy this ensemble, and the support that Central Oregon gives It's musicians. So it's a good experience.\",\n[v12]: \"The first time played in a symphony it was actually with my teacher. I think I was about 10 years old, I had just taken lessons for 2 years and he had accepted the gig [at a] church for a Easter Sunday service. We played Mozart Coronation Mass and was the first time I played in a real orchestra.\",\n[v13]: \"Why do I play the French horn? Well so as you may know in Germany instrumental education is not part of the public school system, it's all done after school in little Music schools and Music Conservatories. I found some elementary music education there from a 6 to 8 and then when the time came to pick the instrument my mom took took me and we went to the open house this one in the Summer where it’s like two days and all the teachers are there and all the instruments are there, the kids can try something and we went and we went straight to the trumpet teacher because It was going to be the trumpet and nothing but the trumpet. And as we saw the trumpet teacher he said “yeah that sounds good, but all my spots are already filled, so you have two options you can either wait a year and I can accept you next year, or you could start with the french horn, it’s kind of like the same thing. And if you want next year you can switch.” And I never switched so I guess I want to say I didn't pick the instrument, maybe it picked me.\",\n[v14]: \"I remember the first time I played in a symphony. Sorry, I didn't repeat the question I should have.\",\n[v15]: \"To me an orchestra is pretty much the ultimate team activity. It's not like in sports where you need another team you need an adversary right? like football games or basketball games or baseball games. Orchestras can play by themselves, and it requires everybody in this team to perform at the right time, the right notes, and to me there just isn't a better thing than being a part of that.

She said that when I was in my terrible twos that I um was always running about and running amuck. But if the TV was on there was always this one commercial uh that had a violin player on it and no matter what I was doing I would just stop. And I would just sit there for whatever moment of time how long this ad was going on the tv and I would just listen to the violinist. And I would just be mesmerized by what was going on and so she decided that he needs to play the violin. And that’s how I got started.\",\n[v125]: \"The reason I Play in the central Oregon Symphony is primarily for the Fellowship of being around other musicians and just For the Love of music There's

pretty hard to make Sound on the elbow and that's a good start so I figured that I would stick with it And I just was I like to challenge You know it's so much fun To know that the instrument Is fighting you every step of the way\",\n[v128]: \"Yeah yeah you know that Is if you think about it you're You're relying on these Micron Thin pieces of wood That you've carved yourself to do To cooperate to make sound which is Is a pretty unique sort of thing That's why I actually prefer playing English horn More than you'll go because it's a larger Reed It's a little more forgiving But you know the oboe is Is is really my\",\n[v129]: \"I play with the central Oregon Symphony because It is just such A wonderful experience See so many devoted people Come together and work To make music

hear that there was an obviously joined Been apart of The Arts in every community of ever lived in and I'm so glad we have Something like this here in What used to be a small town in Bend but is now

mother was a music She taught music in LA county schools and she Didn't want me to do either of those two because she didn't like Listen to the high pitch Some people just learning so She suggested the cello And As much as I was disappointed at first time very happy I went to the cello because It's Heavy to carry bulky but the melinus in the music it makes Texas much Is very nice for me\",\n[v152]: \"We moved up here about 6 years ago And it gives me I play the cello through high school and I quit When I went to college And It's about 20 years later I decided it would be fun we
